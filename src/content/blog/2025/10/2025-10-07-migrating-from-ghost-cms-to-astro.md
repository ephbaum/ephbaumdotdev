![Ghost to Astro Migation Image](../../../../assets/img/2025/10/ghost-to-astro-migration.png)

After years of running my personal blog on Ghost CMS hosted on Digital Ocean, I finally made the decision to migrate to a modern static site generator. This post documents the complete journey from Ghost CMS to Astro, hosted on Vercel.

## Why Migrate?

The decision to migrate wasn't made lightly. Ghost CMS had served me well for years, but several factors pushed me toward a static site approach:

- **Performance**: Static sites load faster and provide better Core Web Vitals
- **Cost**: Moving from a VPS to static hosting reduces ongoing costs
- **Maintenance**: No more server management, updates, or security patches
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling and deployment workflows
- **Flexibility**: Full control over the build process and customization

## The Migration Strategy

The migration involved several key phases:

1. **Content Export**: Extracting all posts, pages, and metadata from Ghost
2. **Backup Conversion Script**: Creating a custom script to convert Ghost backup JSON to markdown files
3. **Image Migration**: Preserving all original images and their relationships
4. **Template Conversion**: Converting Ghost themes to Astro components
5. **Deployment Setup**: Configuring Vercel for static site hosting
6. **SEO Preservation**: Maintaining all URLs and meta data
7. **Final Cleanup**: Restoring placeholder images and ensuring everything works

## The Ghost Backup Conversion Script

One of the most critical components of the migration was creating a custom script to convert the Ghost backup JSON export into properly formatted markdown files. This work actually began much earlier than the main migration effort.

### The Original Solution (October 2023)

Back in October 2023, I published a detailed post about creating a [Ghost Blog backup to Astro markdown conversion script](https://ephbaum.dev/blog/ghost-blog-backup-to-astro-markdown). This post documented my initial research and the custom Node.js solution I developed to solve the migration problem.

The original script was created because I couldn't find any existing tools that would help migrate from Ghost to Astro. The available options were either outdated (last updated in 2019) or incomplete. So I built my own solution using:

- **Turndown**: For converting HTML content to clean markdown
- **Custom JSON parsing**: To extract posts, pages, and metadata from Ghost backups
- **Automated frontmatter generation**: Creating proper YAML headers for each post
- **Image URL mapping**: Converting Ghost image references to local paths

This script served as the foundation for the entire migration process and was essential for automating the conversion of dozens of blog posts.

### The Migration Implementation

The script I developed in 2023 handled all the critical aspects of the conversion:

- **JSON Parsing**: Extracting all blog posts, pages, and metadata from the Ghost backup
- **Markdown Generation**: Converting HTML content to clean markdown format
- **Frontmatter Creation**: Generating proper YAML frontmatter with all necessary fields
- **Image URL Mapping**: Converting Ghost image URLs to local asset references
- **Slug Generation**: Creating URL-friendly slugs from post titles
- **Date Formatting**: Converting Ghost timestamps to readable date formats
- **Tag Processing**: Extracting and formatting post tags and categories

This script was essential for automating the conversion of dozens of blog posts, ensuring consistency in formatting and preventing manual errors that would have been time-consuming to fix later. The work I did in October 2023 laid the groundwork for the entire migration process that would follow over the next two years.

## The Final Mile: Image Restoration

*[This section documents the work completed on October 7, 2025]*

The last step of the migration involved restoring all the placeholder images that had been temporarily used during the transition. This turned out to be a more systematic process than expected.

### The Problem

During the initial migration, all Ghost CMS image URLs (using the `__GHOST_URL__` placeholder) were replaced with `placeholder.com` images to prevent build failures. While this allowed the site to build successfully, it left 13 placeholder images across 7 blog posts that needed to be restored.

### The Solution

Using git history analysis, I was able to trace each placeholder back to its original Ghost CMS URL and then locate the corresponding image in the migrated assets directory. The process involved:

1. **Systematic Discovery**: Found all 13 placeholder images across 7 blog posts
2. **Git History Analysis**: Extracted original Ghost CMS URLs from commit history
3. **Asset Verification**: Confirmed all original images existed in `/src/assets/img/`
4. **Path Restoration**: Updated all markdown files with correct relative paths

### The Results

**Files Processed**: 7 blog posts  
**Images Restored**: 13 total placeholder images  
**Success Rate**: 100% - All images found and restored

The migration was actually perfect - all original images were successfully migrated to the local assets directory with the exact same hash filenames. The only issue was that the image paths in the markdown files were replaced with placeholders instead of being updated to point to the local assets.

### Technical Details

All images now use proper relative paths in the format:
```markdown
![Alt Text](../../../../assets/img/YYYY/MM/filename.ext)
```

The original Ghost CMS URLs followed the pattern:
```
__GHOST_URL__/content/images/YYYY/MM/[hash].ext
```

And were successfully mapped to:
```
../../../../assets/img/YYYY/MM/[hash].ext
```

## The Complete Timeline

The migration journey actually spanned over 2 years, with the initial work beginning in October 2023 and the final completion in October 2025. Here's the complete timeline:
