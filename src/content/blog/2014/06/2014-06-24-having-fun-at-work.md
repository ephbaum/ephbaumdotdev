This might seem completely obvious, but it's important to have fun with your work.

Here's a good example. My boss mentioned that he wanted links on the project I'm working out to stand out. So, I gave him what he wanted:

I was told that this was 'glorious'.

With that a few lines of CSS was used to break up the day a little bit.
