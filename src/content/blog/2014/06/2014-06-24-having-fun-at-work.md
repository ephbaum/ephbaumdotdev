This might seem completely obvious, but it's important to have fun with your work.

Here's a good example. My boss mentioned that he wanted links on the project I'm working out to stand out. So, I gave him what he wanted:

When I showed this to him he said that he thought that maybe instead I should revive the `<blink>` tag. I then presented this to the group:

Finally, someone suggested that I combine these two examples into a one. Of course I couldn't let a challenge go unheeded. A couple minutes later I was able to present this:

I was told that this was 'glorious'.
