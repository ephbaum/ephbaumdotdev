I don't know if it's really necessary to provide a lot of preamble for this entry. Recently I needed indicators. I decided to go with some semi-skeumorphic LEDs and you can see the result in this handily embedded codepen:

\[ See the Pen [djhAt](https://codepen.io/fskirschbaum/pen/djhAt/) by F. Stephen Kirschbaum ([@fskirschbaum](https://codepen.io/fskirschbaum)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io). \]

I may revisit this one later to expand a little, but I think this should all be pretty self explanatory.
